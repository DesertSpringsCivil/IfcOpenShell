"""Tests for ``ifcopenshell.api.earthwork``.

Pure pytest suite — no Blender, no bpy. Each public function gets its own
test class. Round-trip discipline: every "creates an entity" test writes the
file to disk, reopens it, and asserts the structure is preserved.
Idempotent operations get an extra "call twice with different values" test
asserting the persisted entity is updated in place rather than duplicated.
